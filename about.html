        <h2>WHY IT MATTERS</h2>
        <img src="./assets/picture-of-me-1.webp" alt="Smiling portrait of Mitchell, The Accessible Email Guy, in a blue shirt and white pants." /> 
        <p>I'm a writer and a programmer. I design, code, and write copy for accessible emails that can connect with everyone.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="about-section-main">

          <p>
            <span class="first-sentence-span">I have two professional commitments:</span> one as a software developer in the United States Air Force, and another as The Accessible Email Guy; I connect people with your brand on levels that are both seen and felt.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="first-sentence-span">As The Accessible Email Guy,</span> I offer you a double value. The first is persuasive, brand-aligned copy founded on the Plain Language principles the US Government adheres to. The second is hand-coded email templates designed for speed, SEO, and accessibility. I want you to be able to reach every inch of your audience.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="first-sentence-span">So what's the point besides being screen-reader friendly?</span> Accessible copy and code reduce serious marketing risks. For many, the most obvious is not reaching their full audience. But there are some most don't even think about, like the reduction of legal risks and an increase in engagement from better-structured, easy-to-read content.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="first-sentence-span">The legal implications are high, and the precedent can be frightening</span>&mdash;big names (<a href="https://adasoutheast.org/legal/court/national-federation-of-the-blind-v-target-corporation-2/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Target</a>, <a href="https://www.cohenmilstein.com/case-study/national-association-deaf-et-al-v-harvard-and-mit/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Harvard & MIT</a>, <a href="https://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2019/01/15/17-55504.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Domino's Pizza</a>) aren't immune. But properly written code and easy-reading copy will do more to reduce that risk.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="first-sentence-span">Engagement is also higher across the board</span> with accessible content. Clean code and copy means emails look consistent on mobile, desktop, and assistive tech. Fewer display bugs = more readable emails = lower bounce or delete rate. Good structure also benefits neurodivergent readers, ESL (English as a Second Language) readers, and time-constrained readers. <em>Even users without disabilities</em> prefer content that's well-written and clearly organized.
