          <span class="first-sentence-span">Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</span> requires that federal agencies make their electronic and information technology (ICT) accessible to people with disablities. That includes websites, software, documents, and&mdash;of course&mdash;emails. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="first-sentence-span">This includes ensuring that</span> these technologies and mediums of information are compatible with screen readers, documents are formatted in accessible formats, and software is designed to be usable by individuals with visual, auditory, cognitive, or physical disabilities. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="first-sentence-span">Even if you're not a government agency,</span> there's real value in following these standards. Section 508 compliance creates more inclusive environments, better access to information, and a smoother experience for <em>all</em> users. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="first-sentence-span">Holding your brand to the same standard</span> as the U.S. government isn't just ethical&mdash;it's smart. It shows your audience that you're there, you care, and you're ready for everyone.
