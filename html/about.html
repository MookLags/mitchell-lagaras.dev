        <h5>A BRIEF WORK HISTORY</h5>
        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <img src="../assets/picture-of-me-1.jpg" alt="A picture of my smiling face : - )" /> 
        <p>Here's a bit about my work history and the skills I've picked up along my professional life.</p>

        <article>
          <p>
            <span class="first-sentence-span">Currently, I have two software jobs:</span> one as a freelance web developer, and another as a software developer in the US Air Force.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="first-sentence-span">As a freelance developer</span>, I turn ideas into websites that are responsive, lightweight, and SEO-friendly. I'll work with you to take the worry of a fast and cleanly built website off your mind and give you something to add value to your business, portfolio, or existing site, and to make something we both can be proud of. I'm based in northease Ohio, but I can work with you wherever you are in the United States.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="first-sentence-span">In the Air Force</span>, I'm doing lots of studying and gearing up for training; I'll be spreading myself across plenty of tecnhological domains from front-end development to SDR (Software-Defined Radio). This job gives me a safety net above which I can have a flexible career in contracting or even in W2 work and offers great beneifts, all while helping me to develop my skills and serve my country. I work at the 179th Cyberspace Wing, an Air National Guiard Base in Mansfield, Ohio.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="first-sentence-span">In my previous role as a sales representative</span>, I got a taste of self-employment and self-management and knew that this is what I wanted to do. In this position, I was still able to use my development skills to stay organized and streamline my work. I built a terminal-based Client Relationship Management tool that allowed me to filter through all of my prospectice activity using keywords and discrete follow-up dates to ensure I was always as proactive as possible.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            <span class="first-sentence-span">Before sales, I was a teacher</span> in Youngstown, Ohio, and I loved every moment of it. For three years, I taught French, Python, Programming Concepts and Fundamentals, Theology & History, Art, among a few other subjects. I loved my job, but needed something more flexible and higher paying when my wife and I discoverd we would soon be having our beautiful daughter.
